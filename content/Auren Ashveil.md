## Background

Questions for Matt

	- Larger surgery needs to be accounted for
	- What creatures would I see
		- "You might have a passing daydream of small creatures bringing you an object as you telekinetically attract it or you may blink to find you've teleported to your desired location. Spell manifestations from imagination components have surreal or indistinct qualities, and the exact details fade quickly from observers' memory, as sensations from a dream."
	- Thoughts on powers slowly coming about? (compared to them just appearing?)
		- Could go either way
- Miren and engagement timing
- Incident timing
### Childhood

- Childhood was normal and mundane by [[Maekir]] standards
- Parents ([[Galen Ashveil]] and [[Nalia Ashveil]]) still live in [[Maekir]] on the other side of town
	- Their relationship is amicable, but lacks depth
	- He hasn't told them about his powers
### Experimentation

- 2+ years ago `TODO`, experimentation started on him
	- Did this happen during his job? He would show up, go through experiments, then have memories wiped at the end and he would go home.
- Auren has no awareness of any experimentation
	- Knows that there is a period in his life where he lacks memories
	- This year he has begun to have telekinetic powers
	- Eyes started glowing
	- large scar down the back of his scalp
- Experimentation has been ongoing up until the incident?

Auren is unaware of any connection between his amnesia and his parents

### Incident

- A year ago a horde of [[Ghoul]]s were unleashed upon a residential neighborhood and killed dozens
	- Auren's fiance was killed in the attack
- Usually the gate to the neighborhood is kept locked
	- Auren may have failed to lock the gate behind him, but he has kept this a secret 

### Post Incident

- **Finances:** Auren has been living off that remaining finances accumulated from savings and for wedding
	- Has been selling things to provide for others and make ends meet
	- Was recently evicted

### Inciting Incident

- Funds are all but depleted, newly homeless, and its time to get a job again
- Others have mentioned that he has a gift and would be useful beyond a mundane merchant or laborer.
